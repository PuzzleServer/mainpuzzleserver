    /// For most puzzles, teams annotate them by writing on a print-out
    /// of their PDF and teammates share those annotations with each
    /// other by showing each other that print-out.

    /// However, for puzzles with a significant online component, i.e.,
    /// puzzles that are applications or websites, this isn't a viable
    /// strategy.

    /// Such an online puzzle may want a way to store per-team
    /// annotations on the puzzle server itself.  This table stores
    /// such annotations.  Each annotation has a key, which the online
    /// puzzle can use to reference a particular annotation.
    ///
    /// For instance, the answer a team member "writes" in the "space"
    /// for clue number 17 of a puzzle might be stored as an annotation
    /// with key 17 for that puzzle.
    ///
    /// To limit the amount of storage space any team can take up on
    /// the server, annotations are limited to 255 bytes each.  Also,
    /// teams may not store annotations with keys outside the range 1
    /// to n, where n is the MaxAnnotationKey field of the associated
    /// puzzle.
