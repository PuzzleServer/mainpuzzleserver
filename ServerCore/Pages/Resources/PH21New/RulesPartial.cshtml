                <li>hacking into any computer system to find the answer
                <li>modifying something needed by other teams to solve the puzzle (e.g., moving an object referenced in a puzzle)
                <li>giving false information to another team
                <li>trying to purloin answers from another team, and
                <li>colluding with other teams
            </ul>
            Writing a computer program to solve a puzzle is allowed, but this may take longer than solving the puzzle in its intended manner.</li>
        <li>Each team must be reachable by email during the hunt. Important updates and corrections to puzzles will be sent out via email. <b>We may also need to send critical updates to the puzznews alias.</b></li>
