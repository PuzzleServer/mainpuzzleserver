            <p>If you want to join a team and haven&rsquo;t been specifically invited by anyone, you can <b><a asp-page="/Teams/List">find the list of teams looking for team members here</a></b> and request to join.</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re still looking for teammates, you should keep your team open by leaving &ldquo;Allow unsolicited applications&rdquo; checked on your team page. You can use the Bio to describe what your team philosophy is.</p>
