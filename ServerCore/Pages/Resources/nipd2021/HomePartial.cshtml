            <h3>HOW TO SIGN UP</h3>
            <p>If you don&rsquo;t have a team yet, you can <b><a asp-page="/Teams/List">create a team using the link here</a></b>. Teams will consist of 4-6 players with all levels of puzzle experience; each team must contain at least one FTE. Since this year&rsquo;s event is 100% virtual, your team doesn&rsquo;t even need to be in the same place geographically. Once you&rsquo;ve made a team, you can invite specific people to join you or leave your team open for anyone to join.</p>

            <p>If you want to join a team and haven&rsquo;t been specifically invited by anyone, you can <b><a asp-page="/Teams/List">find the list of teams looking for team members here</a></b> and request to join.</p>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re still looking for teammates, you should keep your team open by leaving &quot;Allow unsolicited applications&quot; checked on your team page. You can use the Bio to describe what your team philosophy is.</p>

            <h3>NEW TO PUZZLES?</h3>
            <p>You may have seen a jigsaw puzzle, a crossword puzzle, or a Sudoku at some point in your life, but those barely crack the cover on the whole anthology that is &quot;puzzling&quot;! Puzzleday puzzles also have a tendency to get... creative, so you might see something that looks especially strange! Check out a few <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Samples">sample puzzles</a> or peruse our <a href="https://puzzlearchive.azurewebsites.net/puzzleday/main.html" target="_blank">collection of puzzles</a> from past events.</p>
