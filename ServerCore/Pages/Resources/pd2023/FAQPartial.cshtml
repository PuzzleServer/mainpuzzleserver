            What equipment do I need?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Primarily your brain and a lot of imagination. Every member of your team should have access to a computer. A pair of headphones or speakers may be desired. Building copy rooms will have all other office supplies you may need.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What if I need extra copies of a puzzle?
        </h3>
        <p>
            All Microsoft employees have access to printers.  Just print the puzzle's webpage straight from the browser!  If you need help installing the printer, follow the instructions at <a href="https://aka.ms/FollowMePrinting" target="_blank">aka.ms/FollowMePrinting</a>.

            Who wins?

        <h3>
            How do we know if we've solved a puzzle?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Each puzzle solves to either a single word or a short phrase. In some puzzles you are explicitly told how to get the final answer. In others, figuring out how to extract the final answer is part of the puzzle. <strong>When you think you've found the answer, enter it into the website and it will immediately tell you if you are correct</strong>. Sometimes, you can get a long phrase while working through a puzzle. That phrase is probably a clue to a shorter answer. Try entering the phrase into the website. If the word/phrase is recognized, you may get a &quot;Keep going&quot; or similar message. This means that you entered a valid partial answer and are on the right track.
        </p>

        <h3>
            What is a &quot;Metapuzzle&quot;?
        </h3>
        <p>
            A metapuzzle is a special puzzle that takes the progress you've made from solving other puzzles and combines them in some way. It is not necessary to solve all other puzzles before solving the final metapuzzle, but solving more puzzles often makes progress on the metapuzzle easier. The metapuzzle will be clearly labeled, and it is highly recommended to start looking at it early.

        <h3>
            What is Data Confirmation?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Data Confirmation, or DC, is a feature that certain puzzles have.  When you see the DC logo next to the puzzle's title, that means the answer system will tell you if a particular piece of data is part of the puzzle or not.  For example, if a puzzle has crossword clues, you could type in the answer to a particular clue and system will tell you if you're correct about that clue. 
        </p>

        <h3>
            How do we solve puzzles that don't have instructions?
        </h3>
        <p>
            In some puzzles, the challenge is figuring out what the puzzle is asking of you. The key is usually to look for patterns or common bonds between the parts of the puzzle. For example, are many of the words spelled wrong? Have all the vowels been left out? Sometimes there may be a hint hidden in the puzzle.  You may also find inspiration by looking at the list of <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Encodings">Encodings</a> or <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Tools">Tools</a>. Also, the title is sometimes a hint as to what is going on.

        <h3>
            What's the best way to win?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The best way to win is to solve puzzles quickly so that you get to the final metapuzzle. The best way to accomplish this is with teamwork. Many teams prefer to work individually on the easier puzzles and work as a group on the harder puzzles. If you get stuck, ask for help or switch to another puzzle. Make sure you keep track of which puzzles you've already solved and confirmed using the answer submission system.

            Can I finish by accident, without solving the puzzles?

        <h3>
            I'm not that good at solving puzzles and some of these puzzles look hard. Can I still participate?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes! The event is designed so that less experienced teams will have fun. It's also OK to have teams that consist of some hard-core participants and some casual participants. Our puzzles have a variety of difficulty levels, so there's a good chance there will be puzzles that you enjoy.

            I have an accommodation request and/or require the use of assistive technology. Can I still participate?
