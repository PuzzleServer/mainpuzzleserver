                <h3>WELCOME TO PUZZLEDAY</h3>
                <p>We've drawn up an event that will leave you satisfied down to the last frame: Intern Puzzleday 2022! Our artists have been hard at work inking up a cavalcade of puzzles for you to solve, so whether you're a Disney diehard or a Miyazaki maven, we guarantee you'll finish the day more animated than when you started!</p>

                <p>Puzzleday this year will take place on <b>July 9<sup>th</sup></b>. Solving will begin at <b>10AM PDT</b> after a brief opening ceremony where we'll go over the rules.</p>

                <p>We welcome everybody, and we've provided a <b><a asp-page="/EventSpecific/FAQ">FAQ page</a></b> and summarized <b><a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Rules">our Rules</a> </b> to hopefully answer any questions that would prevent you from signing up. <!--<a target="_blank" href="https://aka.ms/pdinfo">We also have a PowerPoint deck</a> that can clarify a few things.--></p>

                <p>Microsoft strives to create experiences that are accessible and welcoming to everyone.  We are committed to engaging in an interactive process to determine effective, reasonable accommodation we can meet for all attendees.  Please see our FAQ to learn more <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/FAQ" asp-fragment="Accommodation_Requests">and to request an accommodation</a>.</p>

                    <h3>NEW TO PUZZLES?</h3>
                    <p>You may have seen a jigsaw puzzle, a crossword puzzle, or a Sudoku at some point in your life, but those barely crack the cover on the whole anthology that is &quot;puzzling&quot;! Puzzleday puzzles also have a tendency to get... creative, so you might see something that looks especially strange! Check out a few <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Samples">sample puzzles</a> or peruse our <a href="https://puzzlearchive.azurewebsites.net/puzzleday/main.html">collection of puzzles</a> from past events.</p>

                <h3>HOW TO SIGN UP</h3>
                <p>REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN!  If you don't have a team yet, you can <b><a href="https://puzzlehunt.azurewebsites.net/pd2022/play/Teams/List">create a team using the link here</a></b>.  Teams will consist of up to 12 players with all levels of puzzle experience. Each intern can also invite one non-Microsoft-employee guest to join them if they wish, keeping in mind that guest counts against the limit of 12.</p>
                
                <p>While we know that a large portion of interns will be able to participate in-person on the Redmond campus this year, we are still providing a remote experience that allows full participation in the event. It's truly hybrid!  And while that means your team doesn't need to be in the same place geographically, we think there are enough advantages to meeting up in-person that we want at least 1/3 of your team to be located on the Redmond campus during the event.</p>

                <p>If you want to join a team and haven't been specifically invited by anyone, you can <b><a href="https://puzzlehunt.azurewebsites.net/pd2022/play/Teams/List">research the list of teams looking for team members</a></b> and request to join one of them. We recommend for any team that still needs teammates to keep your team open. If you need help finding teammates, you can always ask other interns you work with, know from your cohort or university, or met in cyberspace.</p>

                <h3>FULL SCHEDULE (all times PDT)</h3>

                <h4>PREGAME PUZZLES (optional)</h4>
                <p>These are a great way to get familiar with different types of puzzles you may see during the event and learn how to use our website. The puzzles will be released in the days leading up to the event, and can be found by clicking &quot;Puzzles&quot; at the top of the page (if you don't see a link to the Puzzles up there once they're released, make sure you're registered to play!)  Since these are primarily for practice, we'll go over the solutions at the opening session.</p>

                <h4>EVENT WEEKEND</h4>
                <p>On <b>July 9<sup>th</sup></b> at <b>10AM</b>, we will have a short opening session that will be presented both live in person, as well as streamed for all remote attendees. After that, your team will solve puzzles until later in the afternoon.</p>
                <!--<ul><li><b><a href="https://aka.ms/pdopening">Click here to join the opening session!</a></b> (Will be live shortly before scheduled start time)</li></ul>-->
                <p>After solving has concluded, we will have a closing session where we will announce the winners and you'll have a chance to go over solutions and chat with the puzzle creators. Portions of this will also be streamed for remote attendees.</p>
