        <h2>Rules for Intern Puzzleday 2022</h2>
        <h3>How to play</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>HAVE FUN!</strong> (And if you're not having fun, let us know. If your team is running out of steam, let us know.)</li>
            <li>None of the puzzles require you to do anything illegal, immoral, or that would cause Microsoft security to be concerned.</li>
            <li>Everyone should have access to a computer during the event.</li>
            <li>Access to a printer is optional. You may find some puzzles easier to solve with pencil and paper, but all puzzles delivered via computer can be solved with it.</li>
            <li>You may use your computers to communicate with Puzzleday staff, communicate with your teammates, and help you solve puzzles. You may also use any printed reference material you care to bring with you. You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with a number of common <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Encodings">Encodings</a>.</li>
            <li>While solving puzzles, you can use any reference source on the internet. You can use non-teammate friends or strangers as reference sources for a particular piece of information, but not to help you solve entire puzzles (e.g., you could call someone to ask them a trivia question but not send them a whole list of trivia questions for them to research). You may not send entire puzzles to non-teammates for help.</li>
            <li>Writing a computer program to solve a puzzle is allowed, but this may take longer than solving the puzzle in its intended manner. Also, your computer likely has more tools built-in that can help you than you may realize. For example, Microsoft Edge allows you to draw on a webpage without needing to paste the content into another application.</li>
            <li>
                Hacking puzzles is not in the spirit of the event and is strictly prohibited. This includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>hacking into any computer system to find answers</li>
                    <li>giving false information to another team</li>
                    <li>trying to purloin answers from another team, and</li>
                    <li>colluding with other teams</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In order for a puzzle to be marked as solved, the correct answer must be entered into the correct answer submission box on the website and be submitted before the event ends.</li>
            <li>Each team must be reachable by email during the event since new puzzles, instructions, and corrections to puzzles may need to be sent out via email. <b>Make sure mail from msph@puzzlehunt.org isn't going to junk!</b> Staff won't contact you via the method of communication you're using to collaborate with your teammates, but we may need to be in contact with teams via telephone.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Team registration</h3>
        <p>Teams can have a maximum of 12 people, and we heavily encourage filling up your team as much as possible. You may register your team with only 1 person and fill out the roster later.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The event is designed for Microsoft interns. Each intern may invite one non-Microsoft-employee guest to join their team, for a maximum of 1/2 of the team being not Microsoft employees. All guests must be registered as a member of your team and will count against your limit of 12 people.</li>
            <li>Non-intern Microsoft employees of any badge color (sometimes referred to as FTEs) are not permitted to participate in this specific event; it is only for interns.</li>
            <li>Teams must have a minimum of 1/3 of their members physically located on the Redmond campus during the event.  Guests are allowed to be on campus and there is no restriction on number of guests allowed on campus, although at least some members who are physically present need to have Microsoft badges so you can get into buildings.</li>
            <li>Teams that have fewer than 6 members will be encouraged to merge with other small teams or find more members. At your request, we can help put you in touch with other small teams or your University Recruiter can put you in touch with other interns.</li>
            <li>Only registered players will have access to puzzles.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Winning and scoring</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>There will be prizes for the top ranking teams, as well as at the discretion of Puzzleday staff.</li>
            <li>Teams will first be ranked according to the time by which they solve the final metapuzzle.</li>
            <li>Secondary ranking will be by the total points gathered over the event.</li>
            <li>Should a tie-breaker become necessary for the distribution of prizes, the following criteria will be used to determine the higher-ranking team in this order:
                <ol>
                    <li>The team that has the higher total points by the end of the event.</li>
                    <li>The team that solved more puzzles by the end of the event.</li>
                    <li>The team that reached that point total first.</li>
                    <li>Random drawing.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Teams that are found to be in violation of the event rules will be disqualified from the event and become ineligible for prizes. If disqualification happens before the event is over, that team may continue to solve puzzles at the discretion of Puzzleday staff.</li>
            <li>The decisions of Puzzleday staff are final.</li>
        </ol>
