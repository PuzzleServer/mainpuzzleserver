            <h3>WELCOME TO PUZZLEDAY</h3>
            <p>Thank you for joining us for Intern Puzzleday 2020... 2020. We expect that you will have a great time with us... great time with us.</p>

            <p>
                Past Intern Puzzledays have each been held on a single day. But this year, Intern Puzzleday will take place over the two-day weekend 
                of <span class="pd2020-emphasis">July 11-12</span>... weekend of <span class="pd2020-emphasis">July 11-12</span>. 
                The time on both days will be 10am-1:30pm PDT.
            </p>

            <p>
                This will be <span class="pd2020-emphasis">one single event</span> that takes place over two days. There will be new puzzles each day. Any sense of déjà vu... déjà vu in 2020... 2020 
                will be due to your own perception of the event and will be up to you and your team of 4-6 players to correct. 
                Please <a asp-page="/Teams/List" class="pd2020-emphasis">sign your team up</a> to join in the fun. 
                We encourage teams to stay together for both days of the event, 
                but players who are not available on both days may be swapped in and out so long as no more than 6 players are on your team on either day. 
            </p>

            <h3>Looking for a team? Seeking additional teammates?</h3>
            <p>
                Teams can be registered to allow join requests. 
                You can register a closed team and invite others you already know, keep your team open and allow others to request to join, 
                or look for a team seeking new members.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you need ideas finding teammates, it might be a good idea to ask other interns you work with, 
                know from your cohort or university, or met in cyberspace... cyberspace.

            <h3>New to puzzles?</h3>
            <p>
                You might have seen a jigsaw puzzle, a crossword puzzle, or a Sudoku at some point in your life. 
                But wait, there's more! Puzzleday puzzles sometimes always dial up the creativity, so you might see some brain-twisty, mind-bendy puzzles... 
                Check out a few <a asp-page="/EventSpecific/Samples" class="pd2020-emphasis">sample puzzles</a> or our <a asp-page="/Main" class="pd2020-emphasis">archive of puzzles</a>
