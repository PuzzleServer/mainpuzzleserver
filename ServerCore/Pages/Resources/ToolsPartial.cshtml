    <h1>Puzzle Solving Tools</h1>

    <p>
        If you're wondering how the top teams are able to solve so many puzzles so
        quickly, part of the answer is that they're probably not relying solely on
        their brainpower. Puzzles in the Puzzlehunt often involve anagramming,
        deleting, or otherwise manipulating letters and words to discover new words.
        This is a task well-suited to computers. Since we can't effectively ban the
        use of such tools, the least we can do is share the locations of some of them
        to help level the playing field.

    <h3><a href="http://www.crosswordman.com/tea.html">The Electronic Alveary (TEA)</a></h3>
    <p>
        TEA (The Electronic Alveary) allows you to search word lists for words
        that match a pattern. TEA's pattern language supports simple template and
        anagram searches, but also has the flexibility to perform many more
        complicated queries.  Check the Quick Reference page on the help menu to see
        the kinds of things TEA can do for you. Typing ;STIN for example will product
        all anagrams of the letters STIN (ISN'T, NITS, TINS, SNIT).
